# GOT-network-analysis

This was a project I did in Datacamp.com.

The Project uses Network Analysis to find out the most important characters in the first 5 Game of Thrones books.
The Data set used was pre-processed and constitutes a network and is given as a text file describing the edges between characters, with some attributes attached to each edge.
